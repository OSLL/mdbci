The Mysql Cookbook is a library cookbook that provides resource primitives
(LWRPs) for use in recipes. It is designed to be a reference example for
creating highly reusable cross-platform cookbooks.

Scope
-----
This cookbook is concerned with the "MySQL Community Server",
particularly those shipped with F/OSS Unix and Linux distributions. It
does not address forks or value-added repackaged MySQL distributions
like Drizzle, MariaDB, or Percona.

Requirements
------------
- Chef 11 or higher
- Ruby 1.9 or higher (preferably from the Chef full-stack installer)
- Network accessible package repositories
- 'recipe[selinux::disabled]' on RHEL platforms

Platform Support
----------------
The following platforms have been tested with Test Kitchen:

Cookbook Dependencies
------------
- yum-mysql-community
- smf

Usage
-----
Place a dependency on the mysql cookbook in your cookbook's metadata.rb
```ruby
depends 'mysql', '~> 6.0'
```

Then, in a recipe:

```ruby
mysql_service 'foo' do
  port '3306'
  version '5.5'
  initial_root_password 'change me'
  action [:create, :start]
end
```

The service name on the OS is `mysql-foo`. You can manually start and
stop it with `service mysql-foo start` and `service mysql-foo stop`.

The configuration file is at `/etc/mysql-foo/my.cnf`. It contains the
minimum options to get the service running. It looks like this.

```
# Chef generated my.cnf for instance mysql-foo

[client]
default-character-set          = utf8
port                           = 3306
socket                         = /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.sock

[mysql]
default-character-set          = utf8

[mysqld]
user                           = mysql
pid-file                       = /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.pid
socket                         = /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.sock
port                           = 3306
datadir                        = /var/lib/mysql-foo
tmpdir                         = /tmp
log-error                      = /var/log/mysql-foo/error.log
!includedir /etc/mysql-foo/conf.d

[mysqld_safe]
socket                         = /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.sock
```

You can put extra configuration into the conf.d directory by using the
`mysql_config` resource, like this:

```ruby
mysql_service 'foo' do
  port '3306'
  version '5.5'
  initial_root_password 'change me'
  action [:create, :start]
end

mysql_config 'foo' do
  source 'my_extra_settings.erb'
  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[foo]'
  action :create
end
```

You are responsible for providing `my_extra_settings.erb` in your own
cookbook's templates folder.

Connecting with the mysql CLI command
-------------------------------------
Logging into the machine and typing `mysql` with no extra arguments
will fail. You need to explicitly connect over the socket with `mysql
-S /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.sock`, or over the network with `mysql -h
127.0.0.1`

Upgrading from older version of the mysql cookbook
--------------------------------------------------
- It is strongly recommended that you rebuild the machine from
  scratch. This is easy if you have your `data_dir` on a dedicated
  mount point. If you *must* upgrade in-place, follow the instructions
  below.

- The 6.x series supports multiple service instances on a single
  machine. It dynamically names the support directories and service
  names. `/etc/mysql becomes /etc/mysql-instance_name`. Other support
  directories in `/var` `/run` etc work the same way. Make sure to
  specify the `data_dir` property on the `mysql_service` resource to
  point to the old `/var/lib/mysql` directory.

Resources Overview
------------------
### mysql_service

The `mysql_service` resource manages the basic plumbing needed to get a
MySQL server instance running with minimal configuration.

The `:create` action handles package installation, support
directories, socket files, and other operating system level concerns.
The internal configuration file contains just enough to get the
service up and running, then loads extra configuration from a conf.d
directory. Further configurations are managed with the `mysql_config` resource.

- If the `data_dir` is empty, a database will be initialized, and a
root user will be set up with `initial_root_password`. If this
directory already contains database files, no action will be taken.

The `:start` action starts the service on the machine using the
appropriate provider for the platform. The `:start` action should be
omitted when used in recipes designed to build containers.

#### Example
```ruby
mysql_service 'default' do
  version '5.7'
  bind_address '0.0.0.0'
  port '3306'  
  data_dir '/data'
  initial_root_password 'Ch4ng3me'
  action [:create, :start]
end
```

Please note that when using `notifies` or `subscribes`, the resource
to reference is `mysql_service[name]`, not `service[mysql]`.

#### Parameters

- `charset` - specifies the default character set. Defaults to `utf8`.

- `data_dir` - determines where the actual data files are kept
on the machine. This is useful when mounting external storage. When
omitted, it will default to the platform's native location.

- `error_log` - Tunable location of the error_log

- `initial_root_password` - allows the user to specify the initial
  root password for mysql when initializing new databases.
  This can be set explicitly in a recipe, driven from a node
  attribute, or from data_bags. When omitted, it defaults to
  `ilikerandompasswords`. Please be sure to change it.

- `instance` - A string to identify the MySQL service. By convention,
  to allow for multiple instances of the `mysql_service`, directories
  and files on disk are named `mysql-<instance_name>`. Defaults to the
  resource name.

- `package_action` - Defaults to `:install`.

- `package_name` - Defaults to a value looked up in an internal map.

- `package_version` - Specific version of the package to install,
  passed onto the underlying package manager. Defaults to `nil`.

- `bind_address` - determines the listen IP address for the mysqld service. When
  omitted, it will be determined by MySQL. If the address is "regular" IPv4/IPv6
  address (e.g 127.0.0.1 or ::1), the server accepts TCP/IP connections only for
  that particular address. If the address is "0.0.0.0" (IPv4) or "::" (IPv6), the
  server accepts TCP/IP connections on all IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.

- `mysqld_options` - A key value hash of options to be rendered into
  the main my.cnf. WARNING - It is highly recommended that you use the
  `mysql_config` resource instead of sending extra config into a
  `mysql_service` resource. This will allow you to set up
  notifications and subscriptions between the service and its
  configuration. That being said, this can be useful for adding extra
  options needed for database initialization at first run.

- `port` - determines the listen port for the mysqld service. When
  omitted, it will default to '3306'.

- `run_group` - The name of the system group the `mysql_service`
  should run as. Defaults to 'mysql'.

- `run_user` - The name of the system user the `mysql_service` should
  run as. Defaults to 'mysql'.

- `pid_file` - Tunable location of the pid file.

- `socket` - determines where to write the socket file for the
  `mysql_service` instance. Useful when configuring clients on the
  same machine to talk over socket and skip the networking stack.
  Defaults to a calculated value based on platform and instance name.

- `tmp_dir` - Tunable location of the tmp_dir

- `version` - allows the user to select from the versions available
  for the platform, where applicable. When omitted, it will install
  the default MySQL version for the target platform. Available version
  numbers are `5.0`, `5.1`, `5.5`, `5.6`, and `5.7`, depending on platform.

#### Actions

- `:create` - Configures everything but the underlying operating system service.
- `:delete` - Removes everything but the package and data_dir.
- `:start` - Starts the underlying operating system service
- `:stop`-  Stops the underlying operating system service
- `:restart` - Restarts the underlying operating system service
- `:reload` - Reloads the underlying operating system service

#### Providers
Chef selects the appropriate provider based on platform and version,
but you can specify one if your platform support it.

```ruby
mysql_service[instance-1] do
  port '1234'
  data_dir '/mnt/lottadisk'
  provider Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceSysvinit
  action [:create, :start]
end
```

- `Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceBase` - Configures everything needed t run
a MySQL service except the platform service facility. This provider
should never be used directly. The `:start`, `:stop`, `:restart`, and
`:reload` actions are stubs meant to be overridden by the providers
below.

- `Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceSmf` - Starts a `mysql_service` using
the Service Management Facility, used by Solaris and IllumOS. Manages
the FMRI and method script.

- `Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceSystemd` - Starts a `mysql_service`
using SystemD. Manages the unit file and activation state

- `Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceSysvinit` - Starts a `mysql_service`
using SysVinit. Manages the init script and status.

- `Chef::Provider::MysqlServiceUpstart` - Starts a `mysql_service`
using Upstart. Manages job definitions and status.

### mysql_config

The `mysql_config` resource is a wrapper around the core Chef
`template` resource. Instead of a `path` parameter, it uses the
`instance` parameter to calculate the path on the filesystem where
file is rendered.

#### Example

```ruby
mysql_config[default] do
  source 'site.cnf.erb'
  action :create
end
```

#### Parameters

- `config_name` - The base name of the configuration file to be
  rendered into the conf.d directory on disk. Defaults to the resource
  name.

- `cookbook` - The name of the cookbook to look for the template
  source. Defaults to nil

- `group` - System group for file ownership. Defaults to 'mysql'.

- `instance` - Name of the `mysql_service` instance the config is
  meant for. Defaults to 'default'.

- `owner` - System user for file ownership. Defaults to 'mysql'.

- `source` - Template in cookbook to be rendered.

- `variables` - Variables to be passed to the underlying `template`
  resource.

- `version` - Version of the `mysql_service` instance the config is
  meant for. Used to calculate path. Only necessary when using
  packages with unique configuration paths, such as RHEL Software
  Collections or OmniOS. Defaults to 'nil'

#### Actions
- `:create` - Renders the template to disk at a path calculated using
  the instance parameter.
  
- `:delete` - Deletes the file from the conf.d directory calculated
  using the instance parameter.

#### More Examples
```ruby
mysql_service 'instance-1' do
  action [:create, :start]
end

mysql_service 'instance-2' do
  action [:create, :start]
end

mysql_config 'logging' do
  instance 'instance-1'
  source 'logging.cnf.erb'
  action :create
  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[instance-1]'
end

mysql_config 'security settings for instance-2' do
  config_name 'security'
  instance 'instance-2'
  source 'security_stuff.cnf.erb'
  variables(:foo => 'bar')
  action :create
  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[instance-2]'
end
```

### mysql_client
The `mysql_client` resource manages the MySQL client binaries and
development libraries. 

It is an example of a "singleton" resource. Declaring two
`mysql_client` resources on a machine usually won't yield two separate
copies of the client binaries, except for platforms that support
multiple versions (RHEL SCL, OmniOS).

#### Example
```ruby
mysql_client 'default' do
  action :create
end
```

#### Parameters
- `package_name` - An array of packages to be installed. Defaults to a
  value looked up in an internal map.  

- `package_version` - Specific versions of the package to install,
  passed onto the underlying package manager. Defaults to `nil`.

- `version` - Major MySQL version number of client packages. Only
  valid on for platforms that support multiple versions, such as RHEL
  via Software Collections and OmniOS.
  
#### Actions
- `:create` - Installs the client software
- `:delete` - Removes the client software

Advanced Usage Examples
-----------------------
There are a number of configuration scenarios supported by the use of
resource primitives in recipes. For example, you might want to run
multiple MySQL services, as different users, and mount block devices
that contain pre-existing databases.

### Multiple Instances as Different Users

```ruby
# instance-1
user 'alice' do
  action :create
end

directory '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-1' do
  owner 'alice'
  action :create
end

mount '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-1' do
  device '/dev/sdb1'
  fstype 'ext4'
  action [:mount, :enable]
end

mysql_service 'instance-1' do
  port '3307'
  run_user 'alice'
  data_dir '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-1'
  action [:create, :start]
end

mysql_config 'site config for instance-1' do
  instance 'instance-1'
  source 'instance-1.cnf.erb'
  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[instance-1]'
end

# instance-2
user 'bob' do
  action :create
end

directory '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-2' do
  owner 'bob'
  action :create
end

mount '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-2' do
  device '/dev/sdc1'
  fstype 'ext3'
  action [:mount, :enable]
end

mysql_service 'instance-2' do
  port '3308'
  run_user 'bob'
  data_dir '/mnt/data/mysql/instance-2'
  action [:create, :start]
end

mysql_config 'site config for instance-2' do
  instance 'instance-2'
  source 'instance-2.cnf.erb'
  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[instance-2]'
end
```

### Replication Testing
Use multiple `mysql_service` instances to test a replication setup.
This particular example serves as a smoke test in Test Kitchen because
it exercises different resources and requires service restarts.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### How do I run this behind my firewall?

On Linux, the `mysql_service` resource uses the platform's underlying
package manager to install software. For this to work behind
firewalls, you'll need to either:

- Configure the system yum/apt utilities to use a proxy server that
  can reach the Internet
- Host a package repository on a network that the machine can talk to

On the RHEL platform_family, applying the `yum::default` recipe will
allow you to drive the `yum_globalconfig` resource with attributes to
change the global yum proxy settings.

If hosting repository mirrors, applying one of the following recipes
and adjust the settings with node attributes.

- `recipe[yum-centos::default]` from the Supermarket
  https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/yum-centos
  https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/yum-centos
  
- `recipe[yum-mysql-community::default]` from the Supermarket
  https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/yum-mysql-community
  https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/yum-mysql-community
  
### The mysql command line doesn't work

If you log into the machine and type `mysql`, you may see an error
like this one:

`Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'`

This is because MySQL is hardcoded to read the defined default my.cnf
file, typically at /etc/my.cnf, and this LWRP deletes it to prevent
overlap among multiple MySQL configurations. 

To connect to the socket from the command line, check the socket in the relevant my.cnf file and use something like this:

`mysql -S /var/run/mysql-foo/mysqld.sock -Pwhatever`

Or to connect over the network, use something like this:
connect over the network..

`mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -Pwhatever`

These network or socket ssettings can also be put in you
$HOME/.my.cnf, if preferred.

### What about MariaDB, Percona, Drizzle, WebScaleSQL, etc.

MySQL forks are purposefully out of scope for this cookbook. This is
mostly to reduce the testing matrix to a manageable size. Cookbooks
for these technologies can easily be created by copying and adapting
this cookbook. However, there will be differences.

Package repository locations, package version names, software major
version numbers, supported platform matrices, and the availability of
software such as XtraDB and Galera are the main reasons that creating
multiple cookbooks to make sense.
